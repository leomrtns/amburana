![Amburana](recipe/amburana.png)

Amburana generates sketches of genomic sequences using weighted and unweighted minhash signatures, and calculates
distance matrices using several pre-determined sets of k-mer sizes. 
It also implements several clustering algorithms which are used in these pairwise distance matrices. 
The algorithms implemented include hierarchical clustering (UPGMA, WPGMA, median, etc.), OPTICS, and affinity
propagation.

*Amburana* is a genus of endangered South American trees which are used in the production of cacha√ßa casks.
